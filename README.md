# Light Conditions Style Transfer

## Paper
[Lane Detection in Low-light Conditions Using an Efficient Data Enhancement : Light Conditions Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01177)

Accepted by 2020 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2020).

The main framework is as follows:
![Our framework](https://github.com/Chenzhaowei13/Light-Condition-Style-Transfer/blob/master/data/framework.png)

Empirically, lane detection model trained using our method demonstrated adaptability in low-light conditions and robustness in complex scenarios. (It can achieve **73.9** F1-measure in CULane testing set)

## Datasets

#### CULane

The whole dataset is available at [CULane](https://xingangpan.github.io/projects/CULane.html).
```

#### Generated Images

The images in low-light conditions are generated by the proposed SIM-CycleGAN.


## Source Code

The source code used for the lane detction is made publicly available by [HOU Yuenan](https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-Lane-Detection/tree/master/ERFNet-CULane-PyTorch).

## Requirements

- [PyTorch 1.3.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).

- Matlab (for tools/prob2lines), version R2017a or later.

- [Opencv](https://opencv.org/releases/) (for tools/lane_evaluation).

## Before start
```
conda create -n  your_env_name python=3.6
conda activate your_env_name
conda install pytorch==1.3.0 torchvision==0.4.1 cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Test

#### Test for Demo

We provide demo for testing a single image or a video. 
```
sh ./demo.sh
```
You can get the results as follow.

Result for probability map

Result for points

If you want to test the model for video, you can set mode=0 in demo.sh. 


#### Evaluate the Model

The trained model used in this paper is available in ./trained.

1. Run test script
```
sh ./test_erfnet.sh
```

2. Get lines from probability maps

```
cd tools/prob2lines
matlab -nodisplay -r "main;exit"
```
Please check the file path in Matlab code before.

3. Evaluation

```
cd /tools/lane_evaluation
make
sh eval_all.sh    # evaluate the whole test set
sh eval_split.sh  # evaluate each scenario separately
 ```
The evaluation results are saved in /tools/lane_evaluation/output.
